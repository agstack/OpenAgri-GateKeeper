# GateKeeper
"This service was created in the context of OpenAgri project (https://horizon-openagri.eu/). OpenAgri has received funding from the EU’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement no. 101134083."

GateKeeper is a Django-based microservice designed to act as a central point for validation and authentication for 
all of the following OpenAgri microservices. 
This application is dockerised, making it easy to deploy and manage using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Irrigation Management (IRM)**
- **Weather Data (WD)**
- **Farm Calendar (FC)**
- **Reporting (RP)**
- **Pest and Disease Management (PDM)**

## Features

- **Centralised Authentication:** Manage authentication across multiple microservices.
- **Validation Services:** Provides validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
- **Dockerised Deployment:** Utilise Docker for simplified deployment and management.
- **MySQL Database:** Utilises MySQL as the database backend, with phpMyAdmin for database management.
- GateKeeper is responsible solely for authentication and does not provide any additional features.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openagri-eu/GateKeeper.git
```

## Integration with Gatekeeper

Integrating with Gatekeeper is simple. It just means that your service can communicate with GK, use its endpoints, and handle authentication.

### What integration with GK really means:

- **Call GK’s API** – Your service should be able to send requests to GK’s endpoints.
- **Log in** – If a user provides valid credentials, GK will return an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.
- **Validate tokens** – If your service needs to check if a token is still valid, you can ask GK.
- **Refresh tokens** – If an `access_token` expires, your service can use the `refresh_token` to get a new one.
- **Log out** – If a user wants to log out, your service can call GK’s `/logout/` endpoint to invalidate their session.

That’s it! No complex setup. No extra steps. Just make sure your service can send requests to GK and handle the tokens properly. If you can do that, you’re fully integrated with GK.

## Sample Integration Flow

1. Services authenticate using the API endpoints provided by GK.
2. If the login is successful, the response contains:

    ```json
    {
        "success": true,
        "access": "access_token",
        "refresh": "refresh_token"
    }
    ```

3. Token validity is predefined, and each service must handle token expiration by refreshing the access token.
4. A service is considered successfully integrated with GK once it can log in via `/api/login/` and receive authentication tokens.

### Configure Environement Variables

Copy the `.env.sample` file into a new file called `.env`. Then change its content accordingly. Here is a list of the most important configuration variables and their use:

* DB_<USER|PASS|HOST|PORT>= used to set the database configuration for user, password, the ip address hosting the database, and the port used.
* DATABASE_URL= this is an alternative configuration that can be used instead of the previous one, by representing all the database configs as a single url.
* JWT_SECRET= The secret used to encript/decript the authentication tokens.
* APP_<HOST|PORT>= the web service host (i.e., 0.0.0.0) and port (8001 by default).
* SUPERUSER_<USERNAME|EMAIL|PASSWORD>= Used to create admin user on initial data setup of the system.
* FARM_CALENDAR_API=API endpoit for the farmcalendar. \*
* FARM_CALENDAR_POST_AUTH=Farmcalendar post  authentication url. \*


\* In the future this information will be provided by each service uppon registration, instead of being set in the gatekeeper config.

### Running
To start up the container with the OpenAgri Gatekeeper service, you can run the command:

```
$ docker compose up -d
```
this will start both the DB (postgres) and the Gatekeeper service containers.

To access the service on the web, you can go to:
`http://localhost:8001/login/`
Where you'll be able to login using you admin account (as defined in you .env configurations).

### Stopping
To stop the containers running, run the command:
```
$ docker compose stop
```
Afterwards you may resume them using:
```
$ docker compose start
```

### Removing containers
To stop, and remove existing containers, **including any data stored in the database** in can run:
```
$ docker compose down
```
