# GateKeeper
ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
*"This service was created in the context of OpenAgri project (https://horizon-openagri.eu/). OpenAgri has received funding from the EUâ€™s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement no. 101134083."*

GateKeeper is a Django-based microservice designed to act as a central point for validation and authentication for
all of the following OpenAgri microservices.
This application is dockerised, making it easy to deploy and manage using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Irrigation Management (IRM)**
- **Weather Data (WD)**
- **Farm Calendar (FC)**
- **Reporting (RP)**
- **Pest and Disease Management (PDM)**

## Features

- **Centralised Authentication:** Manage authentication across multiple microservices.
- **Validation Services:** Provides validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
- **Dockerised Deployment:** Utilise Docker for simplified deployment and management.
- **MySQL Database:** Utilises MySQL as the database backend, with phpMyAdmin for database management.
- GateKeeper is responsible solely for authentication and does not provide any additional features.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openagri-eu/GateKeeper.git
```

## Integration with Gatekeeper

Integrating with Gatekeeper is simple. It just means that your service can communicate with GK, use its endpoints, and handle authentication.

### What integration with GK really means:

- **Call GKâ€™s API** â€“ Your service should be able to send requests to GKâ€™s endpoints.
- **Log in** â€“ If a user provides valid credentials, GK will return an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.
- **Validate tokens** â€“ If your service needs to check if a token is still valid, you can ask GK.
- **Refresh tokens** â€“ If an `access_token` expires, your service can use the `refresh_token` to get a new one.
- **Log out** â€“ If a user wants to log out, your service can call GKâ€™s `/logout/` endpoint to invalidate their session.

Thatâ€™s it! No complex setup. No extra steps. Just make sure your service can send requests to GK and handle the tokens properly. If you can do that, youâ€™re fully integrated with GK.

## Sample Integration Flow

1. Services authenticate using the API endpoints provided by GK.
2. If the login is successful, the response contains:

    ```json
    {
        "success": true,
        "access": "access_token",
        "refresh": "refresh_token"
    }
    ```

3. Token validity is predefined, and each service must handle token expiration by refreshing the access token.
4. A service is considered successfully integrated with GK once it can log in via `/api/login/` and receive authentication tokens.

### Configure Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.sample` file into a new file called `.env`.  
Then change its content accordingly. Below is the full list of configuration variables and their purposes.

| Variable | Description | Example / Default |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| `DB_USER` | Database username. | `root` |
| `DB_PASS` | Database password. | `mypassword` |
| `DB_HOST` | Database host address. | `localhost` |
| `DB_PORT` | Database port number. | `3306` |
| `DB_NAME` | Database name. | `gatekeeper_db` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Alternative database connection string (used instead of separate DB variables). | `mysql://user:password@host:port/dbname` |
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | Djangoâ€™s secret key used for cryptographic signing. **Must be set in production.** | `your-secret-key` |
| `DJANGO_DEBUG` | Enables or disables Django debug mode. | `True` or `False` (default: `False`) |
| `DJANGO_PORT` | Port Django runs on locally. | `8001` |
| `EXTRA_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated list of additional allowed hosts. | `example.com,api.example.com` |
| `JWT_SIGNING_KEY` | Key used for signing JWT tokens for authentication. | `your-jwt-signing-key` |
| `JWT_ALG` | Algorithm used for JWT signing. | `HS256` |
| `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_MINUTES` | Access token expiration time (in minutes). | `60` |
| `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_DAYS` | Refresh token expiration time (in days). | `30` |
| `FARM_CALENDAR_API` | Base API URL for the Farm Calendar service. | `http://127.0.0.1:8002/api/` |
| `FARM_CALENDAR_POST_AUTH` | Post-authentication endpoint for the Farm Calendar service. | `http://127.0.0.1:8002/post_auth/` |
| `IRM_API` | Base API URL for the Irrigation Management service. | `http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/` |
| `IRM_POST_AUTH` | Post-authentication endpoint for the Irrigation Management service. | `http://127.0.0.1:5173/post_auth/` |
| `INTERNAL_GK_URL` | Internal Gatekeeper URL used by internal services. | `http://gatekeeper:8001/` |
| `GATEKEEPER_URL` | External/public URL for the Gatekeeper service. | `https://example.com/gatekeeper/` |
| `FARM_CALENDAR` | Optional reference or identifier for the Farm Calendar service. | `FarmCalendar` |
| `IRM` | Optional reference or identifier for the Irrigation Management service. | `IrrigationManagement` |
| `SUPERUSER_USERNAME` | Used to create the admin username during initial setup. | `admin` |
| `SUPERUSER_EMAIL` | Email address of the admin user during initial setup. | `admin@example.com` |
| `SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` | Password for the admin user during initial setup. | `admin123` |

> **Note:**  
> - Variables marked with `*` in older versions (like `FARM_CALENDAR_API` and `FARM_CALENDAR_POST_AUTH`) are still manually configured but may later be automatically provided by each registered service.  
> - Always keep `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SIGNING_KEY` private and never commit them to source control.

### Running
To start up the container with the OpenAgri Gatekeeper service, you can run the command:

```
$ docker compose up -d
```
this will start both the DB (postgres) and the Gatekeeper service containers.

To access the service on the web, you can go to:
`http://localhost:8001/login/`
Where you'll be able to login using you admin account (as defined in you .env configurations).

### Stopping
To stop the containers running, run the command:
```
$ docker compose stop
```
Afterwards you may resume them using:
```
$ docker compose start
```

### Removing containers
To stop, and remove existing containers, **including any data stored in the database** in can run:
```
$ docker compose down
```
